# Specification: Add README.md

## Overview
This track involves creating a comprehensive `README.md` file for the `lembrut` project. The goal is to provide a clear entry point for both developers using the framework and contributors looking to develop it.

## Functional Requirements
- **Introduction**: Define "Soft Brutalism" and the core concept of the project (linking to `product.md`).
- **Installation**: Provide instructions for installing via NPM and setting up the development environment.
- **Usage**: Include basic CSS usage examples and how to integrate `lembrut` into a project.
- **Development Workflow**: Detail the build process using Vite and PostCSS, following the guidelines in `workflow.md`.
- **License**: State the project license (MIT by default unless specified otherwise).

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Clarity**: Use concise, professional language.
- **Maintainability**: Link to internal project files (e.g., `product.md`, `tech-stack.md`) for deep-dive technical details to avoid duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `README.md` exists in the project root.
- [ ] All requested sections (Intro, Installation, Usage, Workflow, License) are present.
- [ ] Links to internal documentation are functional.
- [ ] The content accurately reflects the current tech stack and workflow.

## Out of Scope
- Detailed API documentation for every CSS class (this should be in a separate documentation site or demo page).
- High-fidelity visual assets (images/gifs) within the README (placeholders or text descriptions only for now).

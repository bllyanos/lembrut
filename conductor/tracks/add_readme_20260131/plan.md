# Plan: Add README.md

This plan outlines the steps to create a comprehensive `README.md` for the `lembrut` project, ensuring it serves as an effective entry point for both users and contributors.

## Phase 1: Preparation & Content Drafting
- [ ] Task: Research project details from `product.md`, `tech-stack.md`, and `workflow.md` to ensure accuracy.
- [ ] Task: Draft the "Introduction" and "Core Concept" sections.
- [ ] Task: Draft the "Installation" and "Setup" sections based on the current Vite/PostCSS stack.
- [ ] Task: Draft the "Usage" section with basic examples.
- [ ] Task: Draft the "Development Workflow" and "License" sections.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Preparation & Content Drafting' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implementation & Refinement
- [ ] Task: Create the `README.md` file in the project root with the drafted content.
- [ ] Task: Verify all internal links (e.g., to `conductor/product.md`) are correct and functional.
- [ ] Task: Review the final `README.md` for clarity, tone, and formatting consistency.

# Implementation Plan: Bolder Active States

This plan outlines the steps to implement more vibrant background and outline colors for focused/active interactive elements in the `lembrut` framework.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Variables [checkpoint: 1ccc71b]
- [x] 0482e0f Task: Define global CSS variables for active state saturation boost and darkening in `src/lembrut.css`.
- [x] 6353904 Task: Update base color definitions to support dynamic transformation using these new variables.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Foundation & Variables' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Brutalist Active States
- [x] 765807c Task: Implement increased shadow depth and subtle background saturation for standard inputs.
- [x] b5f75d5 Task: Implement increased shadow depth for custom controls.
- [x] 7a6c590 Task: Implement increased shadow depth and saturated pop-out for buttons.
- [ ] Task: Implement consistent shadow-based focus for cards.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Brutalist Active States' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Validation & Refinement
- [ ] Task: Ensure accessibility and contrast compliance for all new active states.
- [ ] Task: Update the demo page (`index.html`) to showcase the enhanced active states.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Validation & Refinement' (Protocol in workflow.md)

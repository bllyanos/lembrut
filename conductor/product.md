# lembrut: Soft Brutalist CSS Framework

## Core Concept
Lembrut (a portmanteau of "lembut" - Indonesian for soft - and "brutalism") is a CSS framework designed for "soft brutalism." It combines the bold, structural elements of brutalist design with a gentler, more approachable aesthetic.

## Key Characteristics
- **Soft Palette**: Heavy use of pastels to reduce visual harshness.
- **Thick Outlines**: 
  - Black (`#000000`) for clickable or passive elements.
  - 40% Gray for inactive elements.
- **Drop Shadows**: 
  - Solid black offset shadows for clickable/passive elements.
  - 40% Gray for inactive/non-clickable items.
- **Bold Active States**: Reactive focus and active states using increased shadow depth and vibrant background shifts for high tactile feedback.
- **Rounded Corners**: Noticeable and consistent border-radius across all components (e.g., `8px` or `12px`).

## Core Components
- **Layout**: 
  - **Hybrid Grid System**: A standard 12-column Flexbox-based row/column system.
  - **CSS Grid Utilities**: Modern 2D grid helpers for complex layouts.
  - **Responsive Containers**: Fluid and fixed-width containers with tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px) breakpoints.
  - **Alignment & Gaps**: Intuitive utilities for spacing (1-16 scale) and alignment (Flexbox/Grid helpers).
- **Typography**: Bold headers and readable body text.
- **Forms**: Comprehensive input styles including custom checkboxes, radios, and validation states (error/success).
- **Documentation**: A built-in, documentation-style showcase providing visual examples and copyable code snippets for all framework features.

## Target Audience
Web developers looking for a unique, bold, yet user-friendly design system that stands out from standard "flat" or "glassmorphism" trends.

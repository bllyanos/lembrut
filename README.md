# lembrut\n\n**lembrut** (a portmanteau of "lembut" - Indonesian for soft - and "brutalism") is a CSS framework designed for **soft brutalism**. It combines the bold, structural elements of brutalist design with a gentler, more approachable aesthetic. See the [Product Definition](conductor/product.md) for more details.\n\n## Core Concept\nLembrut focuses on a unique aesthetic characterized by:\n- **Soft Palette**: Heavy use of pastels to reduce visual harshness.\n- **Thick Outlines**: Bold black outlines for clear structure.\n- **Solid Shadows**: Tactile drop shadows that give elements weight.\n- **Rounded Corners**: A consistent border-radius that softens the brutalist edge.

For technical details, see the [Tech Stack](conductor/tech-stack.md).
